A **simple music player** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** allows users to play, pause, and switch between tracks with intuitive controls.
The interface typically includes:  

1. **Play Button**: Starts or pauses the current track.  
2. **Previous Button**: Jumps to the previous track in the playlist.  
3. **Next Button**: Skips to the next track.  

This player dynamically updates track information, such as the song title or duration, and provides basic styling using CSS for an attractive design. 
JavaScript handles user interactions, track switching, and audio playback functionality.
